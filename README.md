```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
2. After this you could see a folder called .venv has been created, now let's activate it. Based on different operating system the activation command can vary.

MacOS/Linux
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows
```
source .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Now let's install the dependencies
```
python3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Once done, our django server is ready to be server. Run the below command to start the backend server
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## 4. Setting up frontend server
